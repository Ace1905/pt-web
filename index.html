     <h1>The Top 5 LoL Esport Organisations </h1>
     
     
       <ul>
 
 
 <br/>
 
 
 
   1. <strong>G2 Esports </strong> (LEC): Also known as Gamers 2 is currently regarded as the best team in the game and comfortably on their way to take home the 2019 World Championship. It doesn't seem likely that anyway will be able to stop them reach the title however that doesn't mean teams wont try to take it from their grasp.

       <li> Jankos</li>
       <li> Caps  </li>
       <li> Perkz </li>
       <li> Mikyx </li>
       </ul>
        
        
        <ul>2. <strong>SKT1 Esports </strong> (LCK): SK Telecom T1, the once dominant powerhouse of Korea are looking for redemption after not making it to the World Championship in 2018. After competing in half of the World Championships and bringing home three of them; they will be looking to bring home the fourth. However they will have to push through the storm brewing in Europe.

        <li> Effort </li>
        
        </ul>
        
        <ul> 3. <strong>FPX Esports </strong> (LPL): FunPlus Pheonix are the current best Chinese team over the likes of RNG (Royal Never Give Up) and looking to take the scene from the shadows; however they would have to upset the likes of G2 Esports and SKT1.
        
        <li> GimGoon </li>
        <li> Tian </li>
        <li> Doinb </li>
        <li> Lwx </li>
        <li> Crisp </li>
        
        </ul>
        
        <ul> 4. <strong>RNG </strong> (LPL): Royal Never Give Up are on the rise again and are looking to win the champinship after falling short to G2 Esports in 2018 after an insane five game matchup. Leading the way alongside FPX, could RNG win the 2019 championship for the Chinese region for second time.

        <li> Xiaohu </li>
        <li> Uzi </li>
        <li> Ming </li>
        
        </ul>
        
        <ul> 5. <strong>Fnatic </strong> (LEC): Fnatic are the only team that seem to be able to compete with G2 Esports in the LEC; however they have failed to beat them in a BO5 this year so it is looking like they could fall short once more. However after falling short in the grand finals in 2018, I am sure that they won't want anything less than victory this time around.
